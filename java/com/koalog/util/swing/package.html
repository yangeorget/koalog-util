<P>
Provide a set of classes that let define an application from a XML
file.
<P>
The global structure of the XML file is as follows:
<UL>
  <LI>action declarations: each of the application actions are
  declared using an <TT>&lt;ACTION&gt;</TT> element;
  <LI>menu declarations: the menus are declared using
  <TT>&lt;MENU&gt;</TT> elements, and menu items are declared with
  <TT>&lt;MENUITEM&gt;</TT> elements, which are references to the
  declared actions.
</UL>
<P>
Application definition XML files can be parsed using the
ApplicationLoader class.
<P>
In order to be loaded using an ApplicationLoader instance, an
application must implement the AutoApplication interface.
